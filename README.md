# SmartHome
A wpf application to control smart home devices 

Starting with a raspberry pi radio app this app will control the pi and be able to change songs ect

I will later add light switches when i obtain some hardware

I will also add car devices when i recieve the ODB2 connections and upgrade them to wifi versions

I will then add other devices such as the thermostats and hope to find a way to comunicate with other devices such as the tvs and tv boxes if possible
